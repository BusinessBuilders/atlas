# phone_agent — Atlas answers the business phone

Gives Atlas a phone presence: callers dial a real Twilio number and talk to
Atlas — the same persona, running on the local model. One bridge serves many
businesses: each number maps to a profile (business name, services, greeting,
who takes messages) in a TOML file.

This plugin has two halves:

| Half | Runs where | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| `service.py` — the phone bridge | Its own systemd service (`deploy/systemd/atlas-phone-bridge.service`) | **NONE for callers** — sandboxed by design |
| `plugin.py` — `phone_line_status` | Inside Atlas's brain, via the plugin loader | One low-risk read-only tool for the OWNER |

## The caller sandbox (the point of the design)

Anyone on Earth can dial the number, and callers are **unverified**. So the
phone-facing model gets:

- **No tools, ever.** It cannot touch Atlas's tool registry — no invoices,
  no calendar, no files, no messages. It takes a message instead. This is
  not a config flag; caller tool access would be a separate reviewed feature.
- **Its own settings**, separate from Atlas's: `~/.config/atlas-phone/env`
  (secrets, ports, model) and `~/.config/atlas-phone/businesses.toml`
  (per-business identity). Nothing about the resident Atlas changes when you
  reconfigure the phone agent, and vice versa.
- **A non-thinking model** (`qwen2.5:7b-instruct` by default). Phone callers
  expect an answer in about a second; a thinking model reasons silently and
  callers hang up. If you point this at a thinking-capable model you must
  disable thinking explicitly.
- **A self-contained receptionist persona** built ONLY from the business
  profile — the resident Atlas persona is never imported (it carries the
  owner's private context, and on a live call it leaked the owner's nickname
  and role-played having tools). The prompt forbids inventing contact
  details, prices, or availability, and forbids claiming actions — the only
  facts it may state come from the profile's optional `facts` field, and its
  one promise is that a confirmed message reaches the owner.

Security on the wire: Twilio webhooks are HMAC signature-checked, the
websocket carries a secret token, and relay sessions from foreign Twilio
accounts are dropped. Config is validated at boot — a broken
`businesses.toml` stops the service loudly rather than mis-greeting a
customer. Calls to unmapped numbers hear a spoken config error and land in
the journal at ERROR.

## Call flow

1. Caller dials a mapped number.
2. Twilio POSTs `PUBLIC_BASE/voice/incoming` (signature-checked); the dialed
   number selects the business profile.
3. The bridge replies with TwiML pointing Twilio's ConversationRelay at
   `wss://…/voice/relay` (token + profile pinned in the URL). Twilio does STT.
4. The bridge streams a reply from the local model (persona + profile rules).
   Twilio does TTS. The model never leaves the machine — Twilio only sees text.

## Setup

1. `pip install aiohttp` into the Atlas venv (already present for core).
2. Copy `businesses.example.toml` → `~/.config/atlas-phone/businesses.toml`
   and fill in your real business(es).
3. Create `~/.config/atlas-phone/env` (chmod 600) with:
   `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE`, `BRIDGE_PORT`,
   `PUBLIC_BASE`, `WS_TOKEN` (long random), `OLLAMA_URL`, `MODEL`,
   `ATLAS_REPO` (see the docstring in `service.py` for each).
4. Expose `BRIDGE_PORT` publicly at `PUBLIC_BASE`. With Tailscale Funnel
   (ports 443/8443/10000 only), a path mount keeps existing ports intact:
   `tailscale funnel --bg --https=10000 --set-path=/phone http://127.0.0.1:8890`
   → `PUBLIC_BASE=https://<host>.ts.net:10000/phone`. **Warning:** running
   `tailscale serve` on a port can silently drop that port's existing Funnel —
   re-check `tailscale funnel status` after any change, and never reassign a
   port another app depends on.
5. Point the Twilio number's voice webhook (POST) at
   `PUBLIC_BASE/voice/incoming`.
6. `cp deploy/systemd/atlas-phone-bridge.service ~/.config/systemd/user/ &&
   systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now
   atlas-phone-bridge`
7. Verify: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<BRIDGE_PORT>/health` shows
   `"model_backend": "ok"` and your profiles — then call the number.

## Messages, caller ID, and hanging up

- After every call with caller turns, the bridge summarizes the transcript
  (one non-streamed pass on the same local model) into a structured note —
  name, callback number, email, what they need — appended to the message pad
  (`MESSAGES_FILE`, default `~/atlas-phone-messages.md`). Extraction failure
  writes a loud fallback entry pointing at the journal transcript; a message
  never vanishes silently. Optional `NTFY_URL` + `NTFY_TOPIC` (set together
  or not at all) also push each note as a phone notification.
- The caller's real number comes from the phone network, not speech-to-text:
  it's injected into the call context so the agent *confirms* the callback
  number instead of transcribing digits.
- To hang up, the model ends its goodbye with the literal `[END CALL]`; the
  bridge scrubs the marker from speech, lets the goodbye play, then sends
  Twilio's end-session message. A caller speaking during that window cancels
  the hangup and the conversation continues. **The bridge has the last
  word** — `honor_markers()` ignores (and WARN-logs) any marker glued to a
  reply that asks the caller a question, because a small model will
  eventually hang up mid-intake if only the prompt forbids it.
- Profiles with `forward_to = "+1..."` can **transfer the call** via
  Twilio's `<Connect action>` callback (`/voice/action`, signature-checked)
  answering `<Dial>` to the forward number — original caller ID shown,
  apology + hangup on no answer. Profiles without `forward_to` never offer
  transfers, and a hallucinated transfer marker there is blocked rather
  than becoming a silent hangup.
- **The caller decides, not the AI.** A model marker alone never acts:
  `decide_call_action()` requires the CALLER to have explicitly asked —
  transfer needs a phrase like "operator" / "speak to a person" /
  "talk to {owner}" in the caller's recent words (or such a request plus a
  fresh "yes"), hangup needs a goodbye phrase or a standalone "no". Blocked
  attempts are WARNING-logged with the reason, and a blocked "connecting
  you now" is corrected out loud. Phrase lists are per-profile
  (`transfer_phrases` / `end_phrases`, dashboard-editable; empty = the
  standard set). Replies containing a question can never trigger an action.
- **Overpromise flagging**: commitment language the persona forbids
  ("booked", "you're all set", "I've sent") is detected deterministically —
  WARNING in the journal plus a ⚠ REVIEW prefix on the pad entry and push.
  Design + review record: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-phone-call-
  control-hardening-design.md`.

## Owner dashboard

Set `ADMIN_TOKEN` in the env file and the bridge also serves a control
panel on `127.0.0.1:ADMIN_PORT` (default 8891) — expose it to the owner
**tailnet-only** (e.g. `tailscale serve --bg --https=8447
http://127.0.0.1:8891`), never on the public path Twilio uses. It edits
the number→business mapping and every profile field (greeting, services,
facts, extra prompt instructions, forward number), shows the exact live
prompt per business, and tails the message pad and call transcripts.
Saves go through the same fail-closed validation as boot — a bad edit is
rejected with the reason and changes nothing — and good saves hot-apply
with no restart; in-flight calls keep the settings they started with.

## Operating

- Every call is transcribed in `journalctl --user -u atlas-phone-bridge`.
- Ask Atlas "is the phone line up?" — that's the `phone_line_status` tool in
  this plugin (override the probe URL with `ATLAS_PHONE_HEALTH_URL`; loopback
  only).
- Add a business: new `[profiles.*]` + `[numbers]` entry, restart the service.
- Rotated the Twilio auth token? Update the env file and restart, or every
  webhook will be rejected as a bad signature.
